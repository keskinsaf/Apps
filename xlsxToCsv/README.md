This is a python script that can be used to convert xlsx files to csv files. It will take 
input file as a parameter and will convert any sheets into csv files using pandas library.
It is also dependent on pathlib library, so, pathlib library should be installed if this
program will be used.

Input:
    input file as command-line argument

Output:
    csv files collected under a directory named with xlsx file's name. Each sheets output
    will be a seperated csv file named with sheet name under this directory.

This project will be optimized.
